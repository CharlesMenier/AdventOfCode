# Advent Of Code 2020

[Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/2020) solutions for 2020 edition

All the solution are in `JavaScript/TypeScript`.

## Goals

 * Complete all 25 days (lol)
 * Mainly use functional programming
 * Add visual representation of solutions

# Visual representation

I would like to add a visual representation to my resolution method for the problems if I have time.

# Running

Simply open a terminal at the project's root:

 * Install dependencies with `npm i`
 * Create a `config.json` file at the root containing your session cookie (to retrieve your inputs) :
```json
{
  "cookie": "my_secret_cookie"
}
```
 * Start project with `npm start`
